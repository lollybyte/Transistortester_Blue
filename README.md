# Transistortester\_Blue

Build your own transistor tester on a breadboard and program it with Arduino. Inspired by the original microcontroller-based tester, this STM32-powered version is designed for simplicity, flexibility, and hands-on experimentation.

## Features
- Uses Arduino IDE for programming and customization
- Supports STM32 Bluepill

## Hardware
### Bluepill
